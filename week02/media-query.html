            <h2>Jacob 4:5</h2>
            <p>  5 Behold, they believed in Christ and worshiped the Father
                 in his name, and also we worship the Father in his name. And
                 for this intent we keep the law of Moses, it pointing our 
                 souls to him; and for this cause it is sanctified unto us for 
                 righteousness, even as it was accounted unto Abraham in the 
                 wilderness to be obedient unto the commands of God in 
                 offering up his son Isaac, which is a similitude of God and 
                 his Only Begotten Son.</p>

            <h2>Jacob 4:6</h2>
            <p>6 Wherefore, we search the prophets, and we have many revelations 
                and the spirit of prophecy; and having all these witnesses we obtain 
                a hope, and our faith becometh unshaken, insomuch that we truly can 
                command in the name of Jesus and the very trees obey us, or the mountains, 
                or the waves of the sea.</p>
